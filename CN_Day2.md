Submarine Cables (42:17): The internet isn't "in the cloud" but is physically connected globally by massive fiber optic cables laid across ocean floors. The video shows examples like the Asia Africa Europe-1 (AAE-1) cable connecting multiple continents. These cables are heavily guarded and buried on the ocean floor to protect them.
Wireless Communication (46:21): In addition to wired connections, wireless methods like Bluetooth (short-range), Wi-Fi, and cellular networks (3G, 4G, 5G) are also used for communication. Cables are generally faster than satellites for data transmission.
Types of Networks (48:01):
Local Area Network (LAN): Connects devices in a small area like a house or office.
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): Connects devices across a city.
Wide Area Network (WAN): Connects devices across countries, often using optical fiber cables (50:19).
Modems and Routers (52:11):
Modem: Converts digital signals from your computer to analog signals for transmission (e.g., over telephone lines) and vice versa.
Router: Routes data packets based on their IP addresses, operating at the network layer.
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) (54:31): These companies provide internet access. They are often connected to larger, top-tier ISPs (Tier 1 ISPs like Tata in India) which then provide service to smaller ones (Tier 2 ISPs like Airtel).
