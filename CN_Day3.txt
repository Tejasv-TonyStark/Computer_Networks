NETWORK TOPOLOGIES (55:00 – 1:01:13)

• Network topology describes the physical structure of how devices are connected.
• Types:

Bus Topology – All devices connected to a single backbone cable.
Pros: Simple, cheap
Cons: Cable failure affects entire network

Star Topology – All devices connected to a central hub/switch.
Pros: Easy to manage
Cons: Central hub failure stops the network

Ring Topology – Devices connected in a circular chain.
Pros: Predictable data flow
Cons: One break stops communication

Tree Topology – Hierarchical mix of Star + Bus.
Pros: Scalable
Cons: Complex and costly

Mesh Topology – Every device connected to every other device.
Pros: Highly reliable
Cons: Very expensive (many cables)

OSI MODEL OVERVIEW (1:01:13 – 1:28:50)

• OSI Model = Conceptual 7-layer framework to understand how data travels in a network.
• Top to Bottom:
7. Application
6. Presentation
5. Session
4. Transport
3. Network
2. Data Link

Physical
• Helps visualize how communication happens between devices from software to hardware.

LAYER DETAILS (Deep Understanding from our discussion)
APPLICATION LAYER

• Closest to the user — applications like browsers, WhatsApp, Gmail.
• Provides services for internet communication.
• Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, FTP, DNS, DHCP
• Supports architectures:
– Client–Server
– Peer–to–Peer
• Communicates using HTTP request and response format.

PRESENTATION LAYER

• Prepares data so apps can understand it.
• Functions:
– Translation (ASCII, Unicode)
– Encryption / Decryption (SSL, TLS)
– Compression / Decompression (ZIP, MPEG)
• Example: HTTPS uses encryption done by this layer.

SESSION LAYER

• Manages sessions (conversations) between client and server.
• Functions:
– Establish session
– Maintain session
– Terminate session
• Uses checkpoints so communication can restart if interrupted.

TRANSPORT LAYER

• End-to-end reliable delivery between devices.
• Breaks and rebuilds data using Segmentation.
• Uses port numbers to identify applications.
• Protocols:
– TCP → Reliable, ordered, connection-oriented (handshake)
– UDP → Fast, no guarantee, used in streaming/gaming
• Port types:
– Well-known ports (e.g., 80 HTTP, 443 HTTPS, 3306 MySQL)
– Ephemeral ports — temporary random ports used by clients

CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT (From our discussion)

• TCP Handshake:

SYN

SYN + ACK

ACK
• After handshake, a socket is created.
Socket = IP + Port
• IP identifies the device, Port identifies the application.

ROLES OF DEVICES (From our discussion)

• Switch → Works inside same network using MAC addresses (Layer 2)
• Router → Connects different networks using IP addresses (Layer 3)
• Repeater → Regenerates weak signals in middle of path (Layer 1)
• Hub → Broadcasts to all devices (Layer 1)

HTTP COMMUNICATION (From our discussion)

• HTTP is NOT data — it is the etiquette / rules / format for communication.
• TCP provides the connection, HTTP defines how messages are written.
• Client sends HTTP REQUEST → Server sends HTTP RESPONSE.
• Request has → Method + Headers + Body (optional)
• Response has → Status Code + Headers + Body

KEY ONE-LINERS FOR REVISION

• IP finds the device, Port finds the application, Socket connects them.
• Switch forwards inside same network (MAC). Router forwards across networks (IP).
• Client uses ephemeral ports. Server uses fixed known ports.
• HTTP is the communication language between browser and server.
• TCP handshake: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK.
